Code Conventions

PYTHON
- Keep only the code that evo_game uses. Do not write code merely because it might
  be useful in the future
- Add type hints to:
  + every method that returns something.


VCS (GIT) WORKFLOW
- Never work directly on 'master' branch
- Pull in latest master from remote repo and branch off that
- Remove branches that are merged into 'master'

Before submitting, and if updating, a Pull Request, verify that:
- All existing tests pass.
- You have written new tests (see testing section).
