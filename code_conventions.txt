Code Conventions

PYTHON
- Import statement arrangment:
  +  Top: python library imports. Below: external imports. Below: local import.
     Within each category, alphabeticise imports.
- Keep only the code that evo_game uses. Do not write code merely because it might
  be useful in the future
- Add type hints to:
  + every method that returns something.
- Name methods with the prefix '__' if the method is private.


VCS (GIT) WORKFLOW
- Never work directly on 'master' branch
- Pull in latest master from remote repo and branch off that
- Remove branches that are merged into 'master'

Before submitting, and if updating, a Pull Request, verify that:
- All existing tests pass.
- You have written new tests (see testing section).

Github:
- Reply to any comment on a pull request.
- Do not resolve pull request conversations.


TESTS:
- Write tests for every public method except __str__ or __repr__ methods.
- Name the test function 'test_' + the name of function that you are testing.
- When using assertEqual, the first argument is the expected value and the
  second value is the actual value.
